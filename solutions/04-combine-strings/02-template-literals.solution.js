let bookTitle = "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone";
let author = "J. K. Rowling";

/**
 * This exercise is the same as the previous, except you will use template literals to solve this problem.
 *
 * Create a variable called "bookInfo". It should combine the variables "bookTitle" and "author" together
 * so that if I were to log "bookInfo", it would say:
 * Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J. K. Rowling
 *
 * @example
 * // Declare "bookTitle"
 * console.log(bookTitle); // Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J. K. Rowling
 *
 * This should still work when "bookTitle" and "author" are different values.

let bookInfo = `${bookTitle} by ${author}`;
