/**
 * Use the concatenation operator (the plus sign) to solve this problem.
 *
 * Create a variable called "bookInfo". It should combine the variables "bookTitle" and "author" together
 * so that if I were to log "bookInfo", it would say:
 * Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J. K. Rowling
 *
 * @example
 * // Declare "bookTitle"
 * console.log(bookTitle); // Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J. K. Rowling
 *
 * This should still work when "bookTitle" and "author" are different values.

let bookInfo = bookTitle + " by " + author;
