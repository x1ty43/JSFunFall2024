/**
 * At the "Happy Burger", you have two choices:
 * - A burger ($7.00)
 * - A burger ($7.00) and a drink ($1.99)
 *
 * If "isBuyingDrink" is true, add the cost of "drink" to the "total".
 * If "isBuyingDrink" is false, do not change the cost.
 *
 * This should still work when "burger" and "drink" are equal to different numbers.
